title: Hack to keep focus when bootstrapping
---

**To keep focus when I start new projects, I early on setup a few simple milestones. Sorted, so the first one is the first to strive for, the second the next aim, etc. Until a milestone has been reached, that milestone is the main focus to accomplish.**

For example, when I started to build [Let’s Do](https://letsdo.io), I wrote down 3 milestones: 

 1) _5 beta users_<br>
 2) _5 active teams_<br>
 3) _5 paying customers_

At the time, they felt far away, the product was just an idea and I was just getting started writing the code that would make the idea come to life.

These are simple milestones, but they have been working great for me as motivation and helping keep focus. I keep them on a page in Notion that I am on regularly to be reminded. 

It is a great feeling when you finally tick one off, and realize that you made it. 

For me it has been key to keep the milestones tangible and business-oriented. More practical like ”finish MVP” or ”submit for review” doesn’t have the same bang to me. I think that type can get too practical and reaching them is more like completing a task than reaching a goal.
When there are effects like money in the bank, accountability or customer data in the DB, it gets real in another way. And that gets you focused.

I have been using this method in for different projects over the years, and it has been good way to keep focus be reminided on what is important.
