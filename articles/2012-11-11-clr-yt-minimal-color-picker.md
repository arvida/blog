title: Clr.yt - minimal color picker

~

As a web developer you learn pretty fast how to describe a color using HEX or RGB values, for example `#ff0000` or `255, 0, 0` is the code for red. However getting the color tone right can be a bit tricky without using a visual color picker. 

My process for finding the right color has usually been to google something like “html color picker” or opening up a image editor. Related to this also the communciation problems when you are helping someone tweak a design from remote and they describe a color like “blue, the same shade as my guitar”. 

I decided to try and make something that would make this color stuff easier. Last week I put in a couple of hours and ended up creating yet another web based color picker. It is available at __[http://clr.yt](http://clr.yt/)__. You can easily copy color codes or share colors using anchor links like this: [http://clr.yt/#cc0000](http://clr.yt/#cc0000). It is very basic but does the job for me and hopefully someone else.

Let me know what you think about it or how it could be improved.
