title: Recent open source commits

~
Last week a did two small commits on a project called [mongo_session_store](https://github.com/brianhempel/mongo_session_store). 
It's a Rails session store that uses mongo_mapper, mongoid or the mongo ruby driver to store session data in a mongodb database.
It was started out by [compressed](https://github.com/compressed/mongo_session_store) about two years ago and has had a lot of forks,
many looks unmaintained but [Brian Hempel](https://github.com/brianhempel) has a fork that works good with Rails 3.x and that he is 
actively maintaining. Brian has released it as gem called [mongo_session_store-rails3](https://rubygems.org/gems/mongo_session_store-rails3), 
that we're currently using for <a href="http://unicef.se">the swedish UNICEF site</a>.

 - There was an error in a example in the readme on how you set the <code>config.session_store</code> setting. When setting sessions store your
can't assign the store with a <code>=</code>.

 - I also replaced a few <code>rescue LoadError</code> with <code>autoload</code>. It makes the code a bit cleaner and don't make you require 
 files that you want be using.
