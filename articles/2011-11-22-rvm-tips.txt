title: Ruby Version Manager quick tips

~

I have been using [Ruby Version Manager (RVM)](http://beginrescueend.com/) for over a year and I think it is a great tool that makes life easier for me as a developer. It wasn't until recently that I started to checkout the different configuration options for it.

## Configuration

RVM uses a file called ```.rvmrc``` in your home directory for global configuration. If you need system wide configuration your can use ```/etc/rvmrc```, but the file in your home directory will overwrite the settings in /etc/rvmrc if both exists. 

My ```.rvmrc``` looks like this

<% highlight do :bash %>
~ $ cat .rvmrc 
export rvm_gemset_create_on_use_flag=1
export rvm_install_on_use_flag=1
<% end %>

When ```rvm_gemset_create_on_use_flag``` is set to ```1``` RVM will automatically create a gemset if you cd into a directory with a .rvmrc file that specifies a gemset that doesn't exist. This is good for skipping those ```ERROR: Gemset 'the-app' does not exist ...``` errors. 

The ```rvm_install_on_use_flag``` will make it so RVM automatically install new rubies if it encounters a project .rvmrc that specifies a ruby that isn't already installed on the system.

You can also set ```export rvm_trust_rvmrcs_flag=1``` to skip the prompt about trusting a project .rvmrc file that is displayed when RVM encounters a .rvmrc file that it hasn't seen before on the system. However I keep that setting off because I think it is good to get a notice when you cd into a directory that has .rvmrc file the first time.

### More configuration options

The RVM install includes a file with examples of the different configuration settings you can use in ```~/.rvm/example/rvmrc```. Also check out [the documentation on rvmrc files](http://beginrescueend.com/workflow/rvmrc/).

## Default gems for gemsets

RVM creates a gemset called ```global``` for each ruby version you install. This gemset will be used as the base for all newly created gemsets. It is pretty sweet to ensure that you always have [bundler](http://gembundler.com/) and [rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) available in new gemsets:

<% highlight do :text %>
~ $ rvm gemset use global
Using /Users/arvid/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p0 with gemset global

~ $ gem install bundler
Fetching: bundler-1.0.21.gem (100%)
Successfully installed bundler-1.0.21
1 gem installed

~ $ gem install rake
Fetching: rake-0.9.2.2.gem (100%)
Successfully installed rake-0.9.2.2
1 gem installed

~ $ rvm gemset create my-new-gemset
'my-new-gemset' gemset created (/Users/arvid/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p0@my-new-gemset).

~ $ rvm gemset use my-new-gemset

~ $ gem list

*** LOCAL GEMS ***

bundler (1.0.21)
rake (0.9.2.2)
