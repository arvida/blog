  <article class="post-content">
    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>When going on holiday around christmas I usually have some small project that I feel I haven’t had that much time to work on and decides that I am going to try to finish that during the holiday. Most of the time I do some hacking and end up with some half working code that I forget about. This time I think I managed to finish something (at least a beta).</p>

<p>I recently read Steven Pressfield’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Do-the-Work-ebook/dp/B004PGO25O">Do the work</a>, a book about finishing projects. It is written as a hand book when working on a project and is very inspirational. It makes you think about how you are going to get things done and how to avoid not finishing your current project.</p>

<p>With the ideas from Do the work in mind I decided to finally make something out of a idea I have been toying around with for a while: a menu based Mac OS X app for tracking and reporting time to the <a href="http://basecamphq.com/tour/deliver#/deliver">time tracking functionality in 37signals Basecamp</a>. At <a href="http://oktavilla.se">Oktavilla</a> we have been using this Basecamp feature a lot when working on client projects and it works great when the time has been reported but I haven’t really found any tools for reporting time that fit the way I work and I always end up having to back log time for different reasons. There are probably a great app for this out there that I have missed.</p>

<h3 id="key-features">Key features</h3>

<p>I sat down and decided the three most important features for me:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I want to be able to report time without having to use the mouse, it should just be few key presses to start and stop tracking time and submitting it</li>
  <li>Auto-completion on the task description</li>
  <li>Subtle presence; it stays out of the way when your are not interacting with it and it should be very fast and easy to access when desired</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-result">The result</h2>

<p>The idea was pretty simple but as I am no Objective-C programmer and not that familiar with Cocoa it’s been taking some time.</p>

<p>The result is a app called <a href="http://timecamper.com/">TimeCamper</a>. It’s still very much in beta but I’ve been using it in my day to day work since getting back after the holidays and it does the job for me.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.timecamper.com/graphics/screenshot.png" /></div>

<p>I implemented the key features like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The main form elements are accessible with the tab and space keys</li>
  <li>Submitted descriptions are saved and they will pop up as suggestions as you start to type a new description</li>
  <li>Assignable hotkey for triggering focus and visibility of the window</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="getting-to-know-objective-c">Getting to know Objective-C</h3>

<p>It’s been interesting to get learn Objective-C and Cocoa more in depth, I think it’s a very enjoyable combo to work with. Apple has some great documentation, there are loads of libraries out there to speed up development like <a href="http://restkit.org">RestKit</a>, <a href="http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/">Sparkle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/precipice/HAKeychain">HAKeychain</a>. Also named arguments are really nice and there are a lot of sweet built in utilities like NSObject’s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/nsobject_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSObject/performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:"><code>performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:</code></a> that let’s you invoke a method on a object after a delay.</p>

<p>There is <a href="http://splinter.com.au/in-defence-of-objective-c">a good blog post by Chris Hulbert</a> explaining some of the things you might react to when starting to look into Objective-C.</p>
